%% ===== Instructions reminder =====

%% - The main purpose of this project is to evaluate your approach to
%% formalization, and your comments on the value of the solutions you
%% tried. Investigating several possible definitions/proof methods is a
%% good thing and we value your description of the problems encountered
%% and of the solutions you eventually preferred as much as the the
%% number of questions you answer too. The best mark will not necessarily
%% go to the project answering the maximum number of questions.

%% - Do not hesitate to insert comments in your code...

%% - The report should be a separate, readable document, ideally in pdf
%% format, written in English or in French. It should not exceed 5 pages
%% of a reasonably readable document style (no magnifying glass
%% needed). It can refer to the code but should explain the approach, the
%% problems encountered, and comment the code submitted: is it
%% satisfactory (data-structures, statements, proof scripts) or
%% were some proofs more difficult (or easier!) formally than on paper,
%% what was difficult and why, what ingredient or what method worked
%% well, did you use/lack of some automation tools...
